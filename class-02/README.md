## Notes

- What is state?

- What are props?

- To Update State: `this.setState({ thingInState: thingToUpdate })`

- To send something in props to a child component: `<ChildComponent bananas='randomString' />`

- To access that variable in the props from the child component: `this.props.bananas`

- Information flows in one direction. That direction is ______________.

- What is Bootstrap?

- What are different things that I can customize using Bootstrap?

- How does Bootstrap use classes for customization?

1. Holding state in a parent component and sending it into a child component:

  ```javaScript
  import React from 'react';
  import Child from './path-to-Child-component';

  class Parent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props);
    this.state={
      name: 'sue',
      childName: 'bob'
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <>
          <p>My name is {this.state.name}</p>
          <Child kidsName={this.state.childName}>
        </>
      )
    }
  }

  export default Parent

  import React from 'react';

  class Child extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return(
        <p>My name is {this.props.kidsName}</p>
      )
    }
  }

  export default Child
  ```
